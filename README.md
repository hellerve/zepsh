# zepsh

The *zep*to *sh*ell. Basically a normal zepto shell that sends
any command that is not a meta command or is surrounded by parentheses
to the system shell.

The config file is `.zepshrc`. Both the version in the home directory
and the current directory will be read, where the current directory
version is evaluated later so that it overrides the bindings of the
other file if necessary.

Have fun!
